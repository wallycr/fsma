Sometimes Jesus healed folks in person; sometimes He did so at a distance.  Most of the recorded healings were done in a flash by word or by touch.<BR /><BR /> 
In the case of the leper mentioned in Matthew 8 (let's call him Rafa) Jesus gave this guy the double whammy—both touch and word! <BR /><BR />
I especially like Rafa's approach—kneeling, he lays his hope on Jesus by appealing to His “want-to” rather than the somewhat colder formula many of us plug into our KJV-framed prayers: “according to thy will, o Lord”.  I don't know how spontaneous this was in Rafa's mind, or if he strategized before dropping to his knees square in the Master's path.  I haven't a clue, maybe in Aramaic want and will are interchangeable, but still I like this Living Bible choice of terms.<BR /><BR />
Immediately, Jesus picks up on Rafa's 'game' and He runs with the ball.  You can see the grin and catch a glint of playful delight in the Master's eyes.  He reaches down to fearlessly touch the man—perhaps fingering a rotting ear or nose—and then shoots back: <strong>“I WANT TO!” 
“Be healed!”</strong>  No need this time to hike out to the Jordan and dip seven times.  There stands Rafa in pure unblemished skin as smooth as the proverbial baby's bottom.<BR /><BR />
Partners, will anyone brand me a heretic if I re-touch this story a bit?  What if it had been a hopeful boy or girl rather than a leper?  “If you want to, Jesus, you can help me with the impossible tuition charge at my school.”  Or maybe it was a lone mother, perhaps a prayerful but poor couple trying to meet the cost of keeping the kids in Christian education and a plate of rice and beans on the table.  We have brothers and sisters, members of our church, attempting to get college educated for lives of service; sometimes they are so financially hard-pressed that they go without meals and end up sick and eventually discouraged.<BR /><BR /> 
“If you want to, Jesus,” you can lay a call on the ear of your people wherever in the big beautiful world; please tell them You want them to be Your Miracle Workers in Practical Kindness!  And Lord, could the miracle happen in a flash, or at least before the end of the month?
Thank you Lord, and thank you thoughtful friends, <BR /><BR />

I chose “Rafa” in memory of a friend at church here for whom we all were praying, but he passed away a couple of weeks ago from cancer.  We are always glad for miracles of practical kindness in behalf of needy ones, but wouldn’t it be wonderful to see great miracles of healing such as those performed in Jesus time in Judea?!
