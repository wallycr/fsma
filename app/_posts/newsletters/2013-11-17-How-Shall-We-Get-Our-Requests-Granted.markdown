The unsurpassable promise of John 14:12-14 is brought up again in chapter 15. This time Jesus adds obedience to His commands as a condition for Godâ€™s granting our requests. Some believers might surmise that



{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
